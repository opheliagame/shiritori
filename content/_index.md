A conversation happens in many ways. We call, text, leave notes around the house and drop by to a friend’s house. Being able to share our lived experience is a feeling that brings us closer, makes of people what we call friends.

What happens when friends move countries? When you cannot just drop by and offer to make them food when they are going through a tough time? Even though we can now reach someone at the other end of the world faster than getting out of bed, there is quite nothing like being in the physical presence of someone close.

But we have come up with solutions. Corporations maintain intelligent systems so all kinds of communication can happen anytime anywhere as long as you are “connected” to the internet. Texting someone and going through the steps of knowing they have read it and are now typing can be comforting but also highly anxiety prone. Besides the struggle of getting someone’s attention for long enough to sustain a meaningful conversation, the tools we have also define the kind of conversations we end up having. Be it words, emojis, or voice notes, all we want to do is share what happened today with someone we think will want to listen.

Nekoyama and I have been friends for a few years now. What brought us together was our shared love of Indian food and the curiosity about how our very different worlds are also surprisingly similar in unexpected ways. One of the first times we spoke over video call, we ended up talking about Indian spices and I was struggling to remember the name of this one particular khada masala when Nekoyama suddenly said ajwain and my brain was left to comprehend how a Japanese man knew this name while I, an Indian woman, could not remember it. This was how I introduced Nekoyama to my mother as well; the Japanese man who knows ajwain. And when in the same video call we realised that both of us love FaFa, I knew that we would be friends for very long.

I moved to Tokyo, Japan in 2022 and had been experiencing the struggles of long distance friendships over time zones. So when Nekoyama moved to Mumbai, India in 2025 and had a medical emergency, I knew that I wanted to find another way to stay in touch; something a little less urgent and immediate than calls and texts. I wanted to see India through him and show him the Japan I was living in. That is how we first started our shiritori whatsapp conversation.
